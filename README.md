Features:
Rebinding System: Allows one to rebind virtually any button in the software to a key, mouse button, macro, etc. Simply toggle it at the top to view any set binds (buttons with no binds will be blank). To change a bind click the button and press the key/other-input you would like to bind it to.
Checkpoint System: Set up various checkpoints around the map which you can go to at any time. Useful for routing, practicing, and possibly timing.
Quick Teleports and Teleports: Should be relatively Self Explanatory. Hit the button to quick teleport in a direction or enter coordinates to go to a specific location
Gravity: Change to one of many gravity presets, or enter a number into the textbox
Speedometer: Gives your horizontal velocity. Useful for practicing various dashing strategies, or momentum conservation such as with slopes.
Flight: Toggle with the checkbox in the flight tab. Use the arrows and +z, -z, buttons (which can be bound) to fly around the world. Change the flight speed by enterring a new value into the textbox. Useful for routing because one can get a bird's eye view, make a map, etc. Also useful for getting pretty screenshots or exploring out of bounds.
